## üéØ Use Cases

IP Sentinel is particularly valuable in several networking scenarios:

### üè† **CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT) Networks**
Many ISPs use CGNAT, which can cause your public IP to change frequently. IP Sentinel helps you:
- **Monitor Dynamic IP Changes** - Know exactly when your ISP assigns a new public IP
- **Remote Access Management** - Update dynamic DNS services or firewall rules automatically
- **Service Continuity** - Detect when IP changes might affect hosted services or remote connections
- **Troubleshooting** - Correlate connectivity issues with IP changes

### üîí **VPN Connection Monitoring**
When using VPN services, your public IP should reflect the VPN exit point. IP Sentinel helps you:
- **VPN Leak Detection** - Verify your VPN is working and hasn't leaked your real IP
- **Connection Reliability** - Monitor VPN disconnections and reconnections
- **Exit Point Tracking** - Know which VPN server location you're currently using
- **Privacy Assurance** - Ensure your real IP remains hidden

### üåê **Dynamic DNS & Remote Services**
Perfect for users running services from dynamic IP connections:
- **Home Server Management** - Update DNS records when your home IP changes
- **Remote Work Setup** - Maintain access to home resources with changing IPs
- **Gaming Servers** - Keep friends updated with your current server IP
- **IoT Device Management** - Track IP changes for remote device access
